        Design
      </h2>
      <p>
        Over the past four years, I've designed hundreds of parts including
        CNC-machined and snap-fit injection-molded components as well as
        simpler 3D printed and lasercut parts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Simulation
      </h2>
      <p>
        From using topology optimization to lightweight parts to using structural
        simulations to narrow down snap fits, I simulate and validate all my
        components in FEA. I've also developed physical test fixtures and methodologies 
        to validate these simulations in real life. 
      </p>
      <h2>
        Manufacturing
      </h2>
      <p>
        I've written CAM in HSM and Mastercam for dozens of complex
        multi-fixture components in materials like titanium and stainless. I also
        have mass-production experience working with overseas suppliers at
        Apple.

      CWRU Baja Design: Rear Upright
    </h1>
    <div class="bajacontentcontainer">

      <p class="start">
        I completely redesigned our teams rear-upright for manufacturability 
        using a first-principles approach. I effectively cut the part's size 
        in half while maintaining all suspension-related requirements, 
        reducing machining time, stock cost, and overall
        weight.

          <img src="assets/baja1.webp" alt="Axis and Vise fixture">
          <p>
            This part was a 4th axis fixture along with a
            vise fixture. CAM was written in HSM and
            machine time was reduced from ~8 hrs to
            4.

            Nonlinear dynamic simulation of the entire assembly. In order to get more
            accurate results of various wheel impacts, and properly model the bearing stress
            on the upright, I ran FEA on the entire assembly instead of the individual part.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/baja4.webp" alt="rear upright">
          <p>
            The upright integrates with the rest of the rear suspension assembly, and is
            designed to have zero camber gain over travel.

      <p class="firsthalfshaftparagraph">
        I designed our front half-shaft assembly for the 2022 season as well. It’s validated to take up to 2500 in-lbs with
        a factor of safety of 1.5 or higher across the board. Using materials like Grade 5 Titanium and 7075-T6, our yokes
        are able to achieve max angles of 57 degrees. It also uses bonded carbon fiber shafts in order keep the weight of
        the entire shaft just under a pound.

      <img class="secondhalfshaftimg" src="assets/halfshaft2.webp" alt="half shaft closeup">
      <p class="secondhalfshaftparagraph">
        Because we use a double-wishbone suspension,
        our shafts have to plunge inwards. We use ANSI
        B.92 Splines to achieve this while also transferring
        our torque requirement.
